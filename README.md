# DataAnalysisProject
📊 Project Overview

This project demonstrates an end-to-end inventory analytics solution built using T-SQL (SQL Server) and Power BI.
Using the Microsoft AdventureWorks dataset, a transactional (OLTP) database was transformed into an analytical model to monitor inventory health, supplier performance, and product demand trends.

The goal of the project is to simulate a real-world supply chain analytics environment by designing a data warehouse schema, creating analytical SQL views, and developing an interactive Power BI dashboard.
